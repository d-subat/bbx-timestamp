# FCC Backend Challenge: Timestamp

   
I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
        
## Example:
      https://bbx-whoami.glitch.me/timestamp/December%2015,%202015         
      https://bbx-whoami.glitch.me/timestamp/1450137600
